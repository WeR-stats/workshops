# Why Shiny ?

--

 - Makes it easy to build interactive web applications straight from *R*

--

 - Do not require any knowledge of *HTML*, *CSS*, or *Javascript*

--

 - But with that knowledge apps can become more interesting

--

 - While really quick in building very simple app, problems arise as soon as trying to build more complicated layouts


---
# How to Start

--

 - [Install *R*](https://cran.r-project.org/)

--

 - [Install *RStudio*](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

--

 - Install the *shiny* package:
   ```
   install.packages('shiny')
   ```

--

 - Launch some example:
   ```
   shiny::runExample('01_hello')
   ```

--

 - There are 11 examples already included with the *shiny* package 


---
# How to Start

 - There are much more on the [Github Shiny repository](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples)

--

 - You can run any of them from inside *RStudio*:
   ```
   shiny::runGitHub(
      'shiny-examples', 
      'rstudio', 
      subdir = 'example-name'
   )
```

--
  
 - Or you can see them in action live:
   http://gallery.shinyapps.io/example-name


---
# How to Deploy. For Free

--

 - as a file or a set of files

--

 - zip file: `runUrl('link_to_the_file')`

--

 - [Gist](http://gist.github.com/): `runGist('gist_number')`

--

 - [GitHub](http://www.github.com/) repo: `runGitHub('repo_name', 'owner_name')`

--

Notice that:

--

 - users must have *R* and *RStudio* installed
 
--

 - plus all required packages, data, helpers code, ...
 

---
# How to Deploy. For Free

--

 - [Shiny Server OS](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/)

--

   - build your own machine on premises or in the cloud (see the [instructions](http://bit.ly/wer-setup) on our GitHub repo)
 
--

   - anyone can access anywhere

--
   
   - but you can build your own login system, or simply using a Web Server like [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
 
--

   - needs some knowledge of Linux command line
 

---
# How to Deploy. For a Fee

--

 - [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)

--

 - [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/)
 

---
# Building Blocks. UI

--

 - `UI` build the *HTML* interface, or the layout and appearance of the app

--

   - user *input* controls (see the [gallery](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html) of *standard* controls)
   
--

      meaning "things" on the screen that the user can toggle and change
   
--

   - *output* placeholders, using `*Output` functions

---
# Building Blocks. SERVER

--

 - `SERVER` build matching *output* objects to fill the UI placeholder

--

   - mostly based on the input controls current values

--

   - `render*` functions that matches the `*output` functions in `UI`

--

   - any *R* code embedded in any *reactive* expression

--

   - any other *R* code 


---
# Building Blocks. GLOBAL


 - `GLOBAL` (optional) load and prepare code and data needed by both UI and SERVER


---
# How to Build

--

 - single file `app.R`, needs a call to the `shinyApp` function

--

 - multiple files: `ui.R` and `server.R`, plus an optional `global.R` 

--

 - multiple files in multiple directories

--

 - *RMarkdown* using `runtime: shiny` in the *YAML* header

--

 - package


---
# Reactivity

 - allows to control which, when and how outputs should update

--

 - a *reactive* function is an *R* expression that can use inputs from the UI controls, and returns a value. 

--

 - a reactive function will update its output whenever *any* of the UI controls upon which it is built changes its value

--

 - the update will happen also if the reactive expression contains other reactive functions that have an updated status

 
---
# Reactive Functions

--

 - `render*`

--

 - `reactive`, `reactiveValues`, and  `eventReactive`

--

 - `observe` and `observeEvent`
