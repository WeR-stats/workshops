# WeR Shiny Workshop 11 June 2019. Suggested Packages

All the packages in the following lists, presented in simple alphabetical order, can be downloaded from the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) repository. Their webpage can be reached using the *default* form [*https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pkgname*](), where *pkgname* should be substituted with the actual name of the package you want to review. Clicking any package name in the below lists will open instead, when existing, the corresponding [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository, or an ad-hoc website.

## Main Packages
  - [ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) - The most famous package for making amazing graphics in R. *ggplot2* lets you use the [grammar of graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf 'A paper by Hadley Wickham') to build layered, customizable plots.
  - [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) - A fast way to build interactive (javascript based) displays and visualizations. See also the [gallery](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/)
  - [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) - The perfect workflow for reproducible reporting. Write R code in your markdown reports. When you run render, R Markdown will replace the code with its results and then export your report as an HTML, pdf, or MS Word document, or a HTML or pdf slideshow. The result? Automated reporting. R Markdown is integrated straight into RStudio. See also the [gallery](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html)
  - [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) - Easily make interactive, web apps with R. A perfect way to explore data and share findings with non-programmers. See also the [gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)
